General Information
-------------------
robit.lisp is an internet relay chat automaton defined in common lisp.

This bot exists to make certain things that are confusingly done
in other language's bots simple, using clean, non-ambiguous syntax
and ideas.

Essentially, with robit we want everything to be simple as possible,
while still having the full, functional power of the LISP programming language.

Prerequisites
-------------
- The quicklisp System.
- access to the cl-irc library.

Using this Bot
--------------
To execute, load robit.lisp into a lisp interpreter. For now,
this is assumed to be CLISP. In the future, other LISP compilers
should have support.

Then call (robit:boot) to begin interacting with robit. Happy IRCing!
